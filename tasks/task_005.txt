# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Description Generation with Game Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the OpenAI API service with the core game logic to generate descriptions for the selected words.
# Details:
Modify the game's word selection logic to fetch a description from the OpenAI API after selecting a word. Pass the current language selection to the description generation function. Implement caching for the current round to avoid redundant API calls. Update the game state to store the generated description. Ensure the description is refreshed when a new word is selected.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests that verify the full flow from word selection to description display. Mock API responses to test various scenarios. Verify descriptions update when language is changed. Test error handling during description generation.
