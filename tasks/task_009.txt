# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize API Usage and Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement basic optimizations to improve performance and manage API usage efficiently.
# Details:
Implement simple caching for descriptions to avoid redundant API calls within a session. Add timeout handling for API calls to prevent UI blocking. Optimize prompt length to reduce token usage. Implement basic rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls. Monitor and log API usage for future optimization. Consider implementing a queue for API requests if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance before and after optimizations. Test caching functionality to verify it prevents redundant API calls. Verify timeout handling works correctly. Test rate limiting functionality.
