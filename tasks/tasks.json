Run the initialization command: `npm create vite@latest my-app --template react` or `npx create-react-app my-app`\n3. Navigate to project directory: `cd my-app`\n4. Install essential development dependencies: ESLint, Prettier\n5. Configure ESLint and Prettier in their respective config files\n6. Test the setup by running the development server: `npm run dev` or `npm start`\n7. Verify the application loads correctly in the browser\n\n<info added on 2025-04-12T17:54:30.332Z>\nHere's the additional information to add:\n\n## Next.js Implementation Details\n\n### Setup Instructions\n```bash\n# Create a Next.js app with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS in app subdirectory\nnpx create-next-app@latest app --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app\n```\n\n### Key Benefits\n- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves initial load time and SEO\n- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for optimal performance\n- **App Router**: Modern routing system with nested layouts and server components\n- **API Routes**: Built-in serverless functions for backend functionality\n\n### Configuration Adjustments\n1. Update `next.config.js` to include any necessary custom settings:\n   ```javascript\n   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\n   const nextConfig = {\n     reactStrictMode: true,\n     // Add other configurations as needed\n   }\n   \n   module.exports = nextConfig\n   ```\n\n2. Ensure TypeScript is properly configured in `tsconfig.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n       \"paths\": {\n         \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Verify the development server with hot reload:\n   ```bash\n   cd app\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n\n4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000\n</info added on 2025-04-12T17:54:30.332Z>",
