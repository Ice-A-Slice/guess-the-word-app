# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement State Management for Language Selection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the application's state management to incorporate the selected description language.
# Details:
Extend the existing game state to include the selected language (default to English). Create actions/reducers for updating the language selection. Ensure the language selection persists during a game session. Connect the language selection UI component to the state management system. Implement proper state initialization and update logic.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for state management functions. Verify state updates correctly when language selection changes. Test that initial state loads with default language. Ensure state consistency across game interactions.
