# Task ID: 6
# Title: Update UI to Display Generated Descriptions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the game interface to display the LLM-generated descriptions in the user's selected language.
# Details:
Update the game UI to display the generated description prominently. Add loading indicators while descriptions are being generated. Implement proper text formatting and styling for the descriptions. Ensure the UI handles descriptions of varying lengths appropriately. Add visual indication of the currently selected language.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering with descriptions of different lengths. Verify loading states display correctly. Check that language changes are reflected in the UI. Test accessibility of the description display.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Description Display Context and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a React context and hooks to manage the state of description generation, loading status, and language selection.
### Details:
1. Create a `DescriptionContext.js` file with a React context that includes:
   - Current description text
   - Loading state boolean
   - Selected language
   - Error state
2. Implement a context provider component that wraps the game UI
3. Create custom hooks for components to consume:
   - `useDescription()` - access the current description
   - `useDescriptionLoading()` - check if description is being generated
   - `useLanguageSelection()` - get/set the current language
4. Add functions to update the description state when new descriptions are generated
5. Test the context by creating a simple component that displays the current state values

## 2. Implement Description Display Component with Loading Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a dedicated component to display descriptions with proper formatting, styling, and loading indicators.
### Details:
1. Create a `DescriptionDisplay.js` component that:
   - Uses the context hooks from subtask 1
   - Shows a loading spinner/indicator when descriptions are being generated
   - Displays the description text with proper formatting
   - Handles descriptions of varying lengths with appropriate scrolling/expansion
2. Style the component with CSS/styled-components:
   - Add proper typography (font size, line height, etc.)
   - Create a visually distinct container for the description
   - Style the loading indicator
3. Implement responsive design to ensure the component works on different screen sizes
4. Add animations for transitions between loading and display states
5. Test the component with various description lengths and during loading states

## 3. Add Language Selection UI and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement UI elements for language selection and integrate the description display with the main game interface.
### Details:
1. Create a `LanguageSelector.js` component that:
   - Displays available languages as a dropdown or button group
   - Shows the currently selected language
   - Uses the language selection hook from subtask 1
   - Triggers description regeneration when language changes
2. Add visual indicators for the selected language (flag icon, highlighted button, etc.)
3. Integrate the `DescriptionDisplay` and `LanguageSelector` components into the main game UI
4. Ensure proper layout and positioning of the components within the game interface
5. Add transitions/animations when switching between languages
6. Implement event handlers to trigger description generation when needed (e.g., when a new game object is selected)
7. Test the complete integration by changing languages and verifying that descriptions update correctly
