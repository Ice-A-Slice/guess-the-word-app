# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Error Handling for Description Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust error handling for API calls and description generation failures.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures (network issues, rate limiting, invalid responses). Create user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios. Implement fallback mechanisms when description generation fails (e.g., retry logic, fallback to English, use of cached descriptions). Add logging for API errors to aid debugging. Ensure the game remains playable even if description generation fails.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various API failure scenarios and verify error handling. Test retry logic functionality. Verify user-facing error messages are clear and helpful. Ensure game remains functional during API disruptions.
